**DEPRECATED** This project is no longer supported, and probably doesn't work.

A Java client for directly pushing artifacts Heroku via [Direct-to-Heroku](https://github.com/heroku/direct-to).

Setup
=====
Include as a dependency:

    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.herokuapp.directto</groupId>
        <artifactId>direct-to-heroku-client</artifactId>
        <version>${com.herokuapp.directto.version}</version>
    </dependency>

Quick Start
===========
Example of pushing a war file:

    // Initialize the client
    DirectToHerokuClient client = new DirectToHerokuClient.Builder().setApiKey("your api key").build()

    // Prepare the payload
    Map<String, File> files = new HashMap<String, File>(1);
    files.put("war", new File(warFilePath));

    // Deploy!
    client.deploy("war", appName, files);

Advanced Usage
==============

Pre-Deploy Verification
-----------------------
Before deploying optional client-side verification can be performed to alert users of any problems 
(e.g. files not found, bad pipeline names, etc) prior to pushing the payload to the server. To use this,
use the `client.verify()` methods that have the same signatures as their cooresponding `client.deploy()` methods.
A `VerificationException` will be thrown if any problems are found.

Deploy Request
--------------
The basic usage example above works for standard deployments, but if more advanced deploy options are needed,
a `DeployRequest` builder object can also be passed to the `deploy()` method. For example:

    client.deploy(new DeployRequest(pipelineName, appName, files).setPollingTimeout(3000))

Event Subscription
------------------
This library does not log events directly; however, consumers can subscribe to events that occur during deployment
and perform any operation when notified of events. Event subscription is configured on the `DeployRequest` builder
by setting an `EventSubscription` with `Subscription`s for certain events. For example:

    new DeployRequest(pipelineName, appName, artifacts)
        .setEventSubscription(new EventSubscription()
                .subscribe(UPLOAD_START, new Subscriber() {
                    public void handle(Event event) {
                        // your action here
                    }
                })
        );

Consumer User Agent
-------------------
When this library is consumed by a larger application, it is recommended to set the User Agent for the consumer application.
To do this, call `setConsumersUserAgent()` on `DirectToHerokuClient.Builder`. This will prepend the consumer user agent to
the full `User-Agent` header along with version information for this library in accordance to RFC 2616 Section 14.43.
For example, if you set `setConsumersUserAgent("SuperCoolCiSystem/1.0")`, the `User-Agent` header will be something like:

    User-Agent: SuperCoolCiSystem/1.0 direct-to-heroku-client/0.6-BETA-SNAPSHOT Java/1.6.0_33

Running Tests
=============
When running tests be sure to set system properties for test fixtures:
 * heroku.apiKey
 * heroku.appName

For example:

    mvn test -Dheroku.apiKey=1234 -Dheroku.appName=app-used-for-fixture

Heroku API JAR Cohabitation
===========================

When using this library along with the [Heroku API JAR](https://github.com/heroku/heroku.jar)
in the same project, it is recommended to use the `heroku-http-jersey-client` and `heroku-json-jersey-client`
providers instead of the standard Apache and Jackson providers:

    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.heroku.api</groupId>
        <artifactId>heroku-http-jersey-client</artifactId>
        <version>${com.heroku.api.version}</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.heroku.api</groupId>
        <artifactId>heroku-json-jersey-client</artifactId>
        <version>${com.heroku.api.version}</version>
    </dependency>
